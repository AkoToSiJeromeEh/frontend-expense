<p id="description">Hi there I'm Jerome a student pursuing web development. I'm excited to share my first MERN stack project an expense tracker. This app allows users to add delete and update their expenses and income and it automatically deducts expenses from the user's current income. The app is also responsive so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. In addition to its core functionality the expense tracker also includes interactive components such as charts and cards. These components help users to visualize their spending habits and get insights into their spending.</p>
